# Devlogs  
This file contains devlogs. Some features shown in them may arrive a few months after its first publication.  
**Remember that we are only 3 people working on the mod. And we all have lives besides the mod.** I (Lumaa) am not a professional Java developer, I really started learning by creating this mod.

# Devlog #1 - 08/12/2022
First devlog, wooo!  
What have we been on working on? We've been trying to make the Bacteria work again, but we still fail relentlessly. We also updated the mod in 1.19.2 because of GeckoLib being inexistant in 1.19.1. But now the Tape Player lost his custom hitbox, and I don't know how to fix it lol.  
We have **songs being made** just for our mod by PatateGivree, it will be a music tape. We also thought of making a radio, when you right click on it, it scrolls through all the music tapes (without using tapes). It's been thought of and modeled, but it's unknown if it's really an idea to consider.  

I sadly still have not found a way to generate the Level 0's labyrinth. I thought of something that may work, but it's an idea, and an hard-coded way

# Devlog #2 - 18/12/2022
Hello again!
This devlog is kind of unexpected for me since I said that this devlog was supposed to release in 2023, but if you haven't seen it, we shown in [REPOS.txt](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod/blob/main/libs/REPOS.txt) my newest creation. **LibuLib**. It is, for now, my personal Minecraft library (I'll see in the future if I ever open source **LibuLib**). Why did I do this? Well first, I made it to not repeat code in projects, here's an example: [Your Name Your Death's Colors.java](https://github.com/u-lumaa/your-name-your-death/blob/main/src/main/java/com/lumaa/ynyd/utils/Colors.java) and [The Backrooms Mod's Colors.java](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod/blob/541ef3e3764cf9249e5c9d495d78751edb26aec2/src/main/java/com/lumination/backrooms/utils/Colors.java) are the 2 same files.  
 After implementing **LibuLib**. I'll just have to import the `Colors.java` from **LibuLib**. But there will be more in the future.
 
 Since [last time](#devlog-1---08122022), I fixed the Tape Player's hitbox, we reverted back to 1.19.1, the radio has been remodeled and retextured, and the original songs will come later in 2023. And I (almost) began working on the Level 0's labyrinth. (Fun fact: Internally, we made a lot of notes on "How can we achieve this" using Apple's latest app "[Freeform](https://apps.apple.com/app/freeform/id6443742539)" on iOS, iPadOS and macOS)
 
 Thank you everyone for reading this **<3**
