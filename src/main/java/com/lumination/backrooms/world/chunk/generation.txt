This is just a small document in case I forget how the generation works.

WARNING: Currently, the system is currently pretty mediocre, since it generates each chunk (more specifically,
each room) independent of one another, which leads to very open spaces and to the nap being divided into
sections which you cannot escape. As such, I will eventually replace it with a much better maze system,
which takes into account nearby chunks an thus makes more "backrooms-esque" terrain.

First of all, per each chunk, the ChunkGenerator makes a unique random generator, based on a seed generated from a mix
of the position of the chunk and the region seed. This makes it so the dimension is the same if the same world seed
is used.

Second, the game places four rooms in each chunk, with the floor being in y 0. Each room is an 8 x 8 x 5 structure
containing multiple 6 x 3 entrances. Each room is randomly rotated.

These are stored in nbt files numbered as level_0_x, with x being the structure number. Below is a
dictionary of the structure numbers, with their respective probability of being placed:

crossroad = 0 (4 entrances, 30% probability)
end = 1 (1 entrance, 10% probability)
hall = 2 (2 entrances, 30% probability)
turn = 3 (2 entrances, 30% probability)

Third, the chunk is decorated, with 10% of all silk being replaced with silk planks, and random
chests with level_0 loot tables being placed randomly across the floor with a random rotation (1/200 chance for each
block of air right above the floor).
